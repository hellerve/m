# m

Yet another machine for body-stripping poetry.

## Technical details

`m` is about as simple a text generator as it gets. It is based on Markov
chains and N-grams. You can use it like so:

```
python m.py the_work_to_defile.txt <ngramsize> <textlength>
```

You might not want to use this code, for it is pretty terrible.
